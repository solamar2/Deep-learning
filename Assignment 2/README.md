Assignment 2 involves constructing a convolutional neural network (CNN) and applying it to a real-world dataset and problem. Beyond the practical knowledge of building the network, the assignment also aims to integrate effective logging tools to gain deeper insights into the training process. The specific task is to classify a facial recognition dataset using the CNN.

Several models were tested during the assignment to evaluate different architectural and regularization strategies. The initial model was a basic CNN architecture without additional regularization techniques. While it achieved good training accuracy, it struggled with validation and test sets, suggesting overfitting. In subsequent iterations, weight decay was introduced, slightly improving training accuracy but with limited impact on validation performance. Further enhancements included the addition of dropout, which improved generalization but introduced some instability in validation loss. Finally, increasing the number of channels in the network resulted in the highest validation and test accuracies, indicating better generalization without compromising training accuracy. These findings highlight the importance of balancing model complexity and regularization techniques to optimize performance in facial recognition tasks.
