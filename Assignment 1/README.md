Assignment 1 is centered on the development of a fundamental neural network from first principles, with a particular emphasis on gaining a thorough understanding of the forward and backward propagation processes. The task involves implementing the neural network using PyTorch, with the primary objective of classifying the MNIST dataset. Additionally, the assignment includes a comparative analysis of performance between batch normalization and L2 regularization techniques.
