# Deep-learning

The course on deep learning offers a comprehensive exploration of advanced machine learning techniques, with a focus on the design, implementation, and application of neural networks. It covers foundational concepts such as perceptrons, backpropagation, and gradient descent, progressing to more complex architectures like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image processing, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for sequential data, and transformer models for natural language processing. The course emphasizes both theoretical understanding and practical application, including implementing models using frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow. Additionally, it addresses important topics such as regularization, optimization strategies, and the ethical considerations of deploying AI systems.
